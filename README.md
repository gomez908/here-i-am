# here-i-am
Gonna practice some HTML, CSS, and Javascript here, I think

This is my first post-hello-world repository. I am learning as I go and my goal is to create a website to showcase my film and photography work. I hope to learn some programming languages beyond that, but one step at a time.

I'm hoping that in a month I'll look back at this and see how far I've come. And then again a month from then and and so on.

Here I am, here I go.
